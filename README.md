# AimBot project

The motivation for this project was to write a simple program that utilises information retrieved from object detections to make decisions.

The environment chosen was Counter Strike-Global Offense, a readily available game which had characters that resembles a real person. 

Trials were conducted with two object detectors: YOLOv4 and YOLOv4-tiny.
